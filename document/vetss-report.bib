  abstract  = {Matlab Simulink? is a member of a class of visual languages that are used for modeling and simulating physical and cyber-physical system. A Simulink model consists of blocks with input and output ports connected using links that carry signals. We provide a contract-based type system of Simulink with annotations and dimensions/units associated with ports and links. These contract types can capture invariants on signals as well as relations between signals. We define a contract-based verifier that checks the well formedness of Simulink blocks with respect to these contracts. This verifier generates proof obligations that are solved by SRI?s Yices solver for satisfiability modulo theories (SMT). This translation can be used to detect basic type errors and violation of contracts, demonstrate counterexamples, generate test cases, or prove the absence of contract-based type errors. Our work is an initial step toward the symbolic analysis of Matlab Simulink models.},

Unfortunately, the inherent interference makes it difficult to devise development methods for concurrent programs (or systems). There are a number of proposals such as rely/guarantee conditions but the overall search for a satisfactory compositional approach to concurrency is an open problem. This paper identifies some issues including granularity and the problems associated with ghost variables; it also discusses using atomicity as a design abstraction.},

  abstract  = {Cosimulation techniques are popular in the design and early testing of cyber-physical systems. Such systems are typically composed of heterogeneous components and specified using a variety of languages and tools; this makes their formal analysis beyond simulation challenging. We here present work on formalised models and proofs about cosimulations in our theorem prover Isabelle/UTP, illustrated by an industrial case study from the railways sector. Novel contributions are a mechanised encoding of the FMI framework for cosimulation, simplification and translation of (case-study) models into languages supported by our proof system, and an encoding of an FMI instantiation.},

A key concept in their programme is the design: the familiar precondition-postcondition pair that describes the contract between a programmer and a client. We give a tutorial introduction to the theory of alphabetised relations, and its sub-theory of designs. We illustrate the ideas by applying them to theories of imperative programming, including Hoare logic, weakest preconditions, and the refinement calculus.},
